Introduction
============

The seL4 microkernel is a formally verified, high-performance operating system kernel designed for security- and safety-critical systems, as well as embedded and cyber-physical applications. It is a minimal microkernel that provides strong isolation, fine-grained access control through capabilities, and robust support for real-time and mixed-criticality systems. With machine-checked mathematical proofs of functional correctness and security enforcement, seL4 guarantees properties like confidentiality, integrity, and availability, making it uniquely qualified for systems requiring high assurance. Notably, its verification extends from the abstract model to binary code, setting a benchmark for reliability and performance in the industry. Typical use cases include applications in avionics, automotive systems, and IoT devices, where security and safety are paramount. The kernel also supports incremental cyber retrofitting of legacy systems by integrating existing software into secure environments using virtual machines, as demonstrated in projects like DARPA’s HACMS for the Boeing ULB helicopter. This enables modernization without a complete overhaul, combining robust security with practical adaptability.

What is seL4?
=============

The seL4 microkernel serves as both an operating system microkernel and a hypervisor, designed to minimize the trusted computing base (TCB) while providing robust functionality. As a **microkernel**, it focuses on securely multiplexing hardware resources, leaving traditional OS services to user-space programs, thereby ensuring strong isolation and reducing attack surfaces. It also operates as a **hypervisor**, enabling virtual machines to run securely alongside native applications. The microkernel is formally verified, offering machine-checked proofs of functional correctness and security enforcement, ensuring it is free of implementation defects and capable of guaranteeing confidentiality, integrity, and availability in critical systems. Its fine-grained access control is achieved through a capability-based model, supporting the principle of least privilege for enhanced security. Additionally, seL4 supports **real-time systems** with complete and sound analysis of worst-case execution time, making it suitable for hard real-time and mixed-criticality environments. Widely deployed in applications such as autonomous vehicles, defense systems, and embedded devices, seL4 is also ideal for retrofitting legacy systems, integrating existing software stacks securely and incrementally.

seL4 is a Microkernel, not an OS
--------------------------------

The seL4 microkernel differs fundamentally from monolithic kernels, such as Linux, by drastically reducing the code running in privileged mode, thereby minimizing the trusted computing base (TCB) and attack surface. Monolithic kernels implement all essential services, including device drivers and file systems, within the kernel itself, resulting in tens of millions of lines of code and higher susceptibility to vulnerabilities. In contrast, microkernels like seL4 implement only the minimal functionality necessary to manage hardware and isolate processes, with other OS services delegated to user-space programs. This design isolates faults to specific components, improving both security and system resilience. The seL4 microkernel architecture provides strong isolation through sandboxes, fine-grained access control via capabilities, and a lightweight, low-level API. This minimalist approach makes seL4 particularly suitable for security- and safety-critical systems, enabling modularity and efficient resource utilization without compromising performance or reliability.

Hypervisor Capabilities
-----------------------

As a hypervisor, seL4 provides robust support for virtual machines, enabling the secure execution of fully-fledged operating systems, such as Linux, alongside native applications. By leveraging its fine-grained capability-based access control, seL4 enforces strict isolation between virtual machines, native services, and applications, ensuring that faults or compromises in one domain cannot impact others. Virtualization in seL4 allows seamless integration of native components and VM-hosted services, where native services, such as protocol stacks or device drivers, can securely interact with virtualized components through well-defined communication channels. This architecture supports incremental modernization, allowing existing legacy systems to run in virtual machines while newer components operate natively, enhancing both security and performance without requiring a complete system overhaul.

seL4 for Real-time Systems
--------------------------

The seL4 microkernel is uniquely equipped for real-time systems, combining robust security with precise timing guarantees essential for critical applications. Its priority-based scheduling ensures predictable execution, allowing developers to control thread priorities and meet strict deadlines. Unlike many real-time operating systems (RTOS), seL4 provides bounded worst-case execution times for all kernel operations, which have been rigorously analyzed for soundness. This ensures that interrupt latencies remain predictable and minimal, even under heavy workloads. The kernel’s support for mixed-criticality systems (MCS) enables components with different safety and timing requirements to coexist securely on the same platform, with strong isolation preventing interference. By leveraging its capability-based resource management, seL4 ensures that time resources are allocated and enforced with the same precision and security as memory and I/O, making it ideal for applications such as avionics, autonomous vehicles, and other time-critical embedded systems.

Assurance and Verification
==========================

Verification of seL4
--------------------

The seL4 microkernel is the first operating system kernel to achieve formal, machine-checked verification of functional correctness, ensuring that its implementation conforms precisely to its high-level specification. This guarantees the absence of implementation defects such as buffer overflows, null-pointer dereferences, and code injection vulnerabilities. To address potential issues with compiler behavior, seL4 extends its verification through translation validation, proving that the compiled binary faithfully represents the verified source code, even under optimizations. This process ensures that the kernel’s high assurance extends to its deployed form. Additionally, seL4’s verification includes proofs of security properties, such as confidentiality, integrity, and availability, demonstrating that the kernel enforces strict access controls and isolates components effectively. These proofs rely on explicit assumptions, including hardware correctness, the accuracy of specifications, and the reliability of the theorem prover. Despite challenges in bridging the gap between formal reasoning and real-world execution, seL4’s rigorous approach sets a new benchmark for security and reliability in critical systems.

Functional correctness
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Functional correctness refers to the rigorous proof that the seL4 microkernel’s C implementation is free from defects and adheres to a formal specification of its functionality, expressed in higher-order logic (HOL). This ensures that the kernel’s behavior strictly aligns with its abstract model, ruling out unintended actions and vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows or code injection. Using the Isabelle/HOL theorem prover, the kernel’s C code is translated into mathematical logic for formal verification. By limiting the use of C to a well-defined subset with unambiguous semantics, seL4 ensures its implementation remains provably correct, providing a robust foundation for high-assurance systems.

Translation validation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While a bug-free C implementation of the seL4 kernel ensures a high level of reliability, it does not eliminate the risks posed by the C compiler, which is itself a complex system potentially containing bugs or malicious code. Compilers could introduce defects during the translation of C code into executable binaries or even include Trojan backdoors, as famously described by Ken Thompson in his Turing Award lecture. To mitigate these risks, seL4 employs translation validation, a process that verifies the compiled binary against the formally verified C code to ensure equivalence. This is achieved through an automated toolchain that includes the formalization of the processor’s instruction set architecture (ISA), disassembly of the binary, and transformation of both the binary and C code into a graph-based intermediate representation. The equivalence of these representations is then proven using SMT solvers and rewrite rules. By validating that the compiler’s output is consistent with the abstract specification, seL4 ensures that its high-assurance guarantees extend all the way to the executable binary, bridging the gap between the formal model and real-world deployment.

Security properties
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The seL4 microkernel provides formal proofs of key security properties, ensuring that its design enforces confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA). These properties guarantee that in a correctly configured system, seL4 strictly controls data access and resource usage. Specifically, confidentiality ensures that no entity can read or infer data without explicit read permissions, integrity prevents unauthorized modifications to data, and availability protects against denial of authorized resource access. These proofs demonstrate the kernel’s ability to secure critical systems against many common attack vectors. However, the current model does not yet cover timing-related security issues, such as covert timing channels exploited in attacks like Spectre. Efforts are ongoing to address these challenges, while the mixed-criticality systems (MCS) model extends integrity and availability guarantees to include timeliness, ensuring comprehensive security for real-time environments.

Proof assumptions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Formal reasoning, as used in the verification of seL4, ensures that all assumptions about correctness are explicitly defined and clearly stated. Unlike informal reasoning, where implicit assumptions can be overlooked, machine-checked proofs require every assumption to be documented for the verification process to succeed. This rigor prevents the risks of forgetting or misinterpreting assumptions and provides a clearer understanding of the system’s dependencies and limitations. This explicitness is a fundamental advantage of formal verification, enhancing both clarity and confidence in the correctness of the system.

Assumptions in the Verification of seL4:

- **Hardware behaves as expected**: The kernel relies on the underlying hardware to function correctly; if the hardware is faulty or contains malicious components, the kernel’s guarantees cannot hold.
- **The specification matches expectations**: The formal specification must accurately represent the intended behavior; while properties can be proven about the spec, there will always be some gap between mathematical reasoning and real-world interpretation.
- **The theorem prover is correct**: Although theorem provers like Isabelle/HOL are complex, their small and well-tested core makes the risk of a critical bug introducing errors extremely low.

CAmkES component framework
--------------------------

CAmkES (Component Architecture for microkernel-based Embedded Systems) is a framework for designing systems on the seL4 microkernel as collections of isolated components with defined communication channels. Components interact via interfaces and one-to-one connectors, with the architecture specified in a formal ADL to ensure accurate and secure representation of system interactions.  This framework simplifies the design, verification, and implementation of secure and reliable systems.

Main Abstractions in CAmkES:
- **Components**: Represented as square boxes, these are self-contained units of code and data encapsulated by seL4, functioning as independent programs within the system.
- **Interfaces**: These define how a component can interact with others, either by importing (invoking another component’s interface) or exporting (being invoked by others). Shared-memory interfaces are symmetric and allow direct data sharing.
- **Connectors**: These link importing and exporting interfaces to enable communication between components. While connectors are inherently one-to-one, additional components can be used to implement broadcast or multicast functionality.

CAmkES enables the architectural reasoning of systems as collections of sandboxed components with clearly defined communication channels. Components, represented as square boxes, encapsulate programs, code, and data managed by seL4. Each component interacts with others through interfaces that can either be imported (invoking other components) or exported (allowing invocation by others). Communication between components is established using connectors, which link an importing interface to an exporting one. While connectors are inherently one-to-one, additional components can implement broadcast or multicast functionality. The overall system is specified using the CAmkES ADL, which provides a formal representation of components, interfaces, and connectors, ensuring that only the interactions explicitly defined in the specification are possible.

The ADL description is automatically translated into a lower-level language, CapDL (Capability Distribution Language), which precisely defines the seL4 objects and their access rights. This translation allows the system to be mapped onto the seL4 kernel, ensuring that the architecture described in ADL is faithfully implemented and enforced. Additionally, the framework generates startup code that initializes seL4 objects and allocates capabilities to match the CapDL specification, ensuring the system is set up correctly. It also produces “glue” code that abstracts complex seL4 system calls for communication between components, making them appear as simple function calls. Together, these automated steps reduce complexity while maintaining the security and reliability of the system, with ongoing verification efforts to enhance the assurance provided by CAmkES and CapDL.

Capabilities
============

What are Capabilities
---------------------

Capabilities in seL4 are object references similar to pointers but with added access rights.  Unlike regular pointers, capabilities are immutable, uniquely referencing specific objects while encapsulating the rights required to operate on them. In a capability-based system like seL4, invoking a capability is the sole method for performing operations on system objects, ensuring fine-grained, object-oriented access control. For example, a capability may allow a function call to an object or grant the right to pass another capability to delegate access. This design adheres to the principle of least privilege, restricting access to the minimum rights necessary for a component to perform its task. Unlike traditional access-control lists (ACLs) used in systems like Linux, seL4 capabilities avoid common vulnerabilities such as the confused deputy problem and are protected by the kernel rather than hardware. seL4 defines ten types of objects managed by capabilities, including endpoints for function calls, address spaces for isolation, and scheduling contexts for CPU time allocation, offering comprehensive control and security in critical systems.

Advantages of Capabilities
--------------------------

Fine-grained access control
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Capabilities enable fine-grained, object-oriented access control that aligns with the principle of least privilege (POLA), offering a significant advantage over traditional access-control lists (ACLs) used in systems like Linux. ACLs rely on a subject-oriented scheme, granting access based on user or group IDs, which results in coarse-grained permissions and limits the enforcement of precise security policies. For example, in Linux, there is no clean way to confine an untrusted program to accessing only specific files without cumbersome workarounds like chroot jails or containers. In contrast, capabilities allow precise control by granting an application access only to explicitly authorized resources. In a confinement scenario, a user can provide an untrusted program with capabilities to access specific files for reading or writing, ensuring it cannot interact with other resources, thus achieving true least privilege.

Solutions for delegation and interposition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Capabilities provide unique advantages such as interposition and efficient delegation of privileges. Interposition allows access to be mediated transparently, as capabilities are opaque references. For instance, a capability given to a user can point to a security monitor instead of the actual resource, enabling the monitor to validate operations and virtualize the resource. This technique is useful for enforcing security policies, packet filtering, and even debugging. Additionally, capabilities simplify delegation by allowing users to “mint” new capabilities with specific permissions, such as read-only access, and pass them to others. These capabilities can be revoked at any time, enhancing control. Delegation also supports autonomous resource management, enabling subsystems to manage their resources independently while maintaining isolation and security. This flexibility is challenging to achieve with traditional access-control systems.

Avoidance of the confused deputy problem
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The confused deputy problem highlights a fundamental flaw in ACL-based systems, where access rights are determined by the security state of the executing program (the “deputy”) rather than the user requesting the operation. For example, a C compiler with elevated privileges can be tricked by a malicious user into overwriting critical files, such as a password file, because the system relies on the compiler’s authority instead of the user’s. This flaw arises from “ambient authority,” where the separation of denomination (file reference) and authority (access rights) enables such exploits. Capability systems solve this by coupling denomination and authority—requiring the user to provide explicit capabilities for each operation. With capabilities, the compiler acts only within the authority explicitly granted by the user, eliminating the risk of confusion. This makes capability-based systems essential for truly secure operating environments.

Real-Time Systems
=================

Hard Real-Time Support
----------------------

seL4 employs a simple, priority-based scheduling policy that ensures deterministic behavior, a critical requirement for hard real-time systems. Unlike some kernels, seL4 never adjusts priorities autonomously, leaving full control to the user. To maintain bounded interrupt latencies, seL4 disables interrupts while in kernel mode, simplifying its design and eliminating the need for complex concurrency control. This approach enhances average-case performance and enables formal verification of the kernel. Contrary to the belief that real-time operating systems must be preemptible to achieve low interrupt latencies, seL4 demonstrates that in protected-mode systems with memory protection, the context-switch overhead makes preemption unnecessary. Instead, the kernel achieves low latencies through short, efficient system calls, avoiding the complexity and risk of preemptible designs.

For operations that may run longer, such as capability revocation, seL4 uses a technique called incremental consistency. This breaks the operation into smaller sub-operations, each transitioning the kernel to a consistent state. If an interrupt occurs, the current operation is aborted, the interrupt is processed, and the operation resumes from where it was stopped, ensuring progress without compromising responsiveness. Additionally, seL4 stands out with its sound and complete worst-case execution time (WCET) analysis, providing provable upper bounds for system call and interrupt latencies—an essential feature for safety-critical systems. While such analysis has been abandoned for some architectures due to a lack of necessary data, the emergence of open-source RISC-V processors presents an opportunity to reapply and extend this capability, further reinforcing seL4’s suitability for real-time and safety-critical environments.

Mixed-Criticality Systems (MCS)
-------------------------------

What is mixed-criticality
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A mixed-criticality system (MCS) consists of components with varying levels of criticality, where criticality refers to the severity of consequences in the event of a failure. For example, avionics standards classify failures from “no effect” to “catastrophic.” The primary safety requirement in an MCS is strong isolation, ensuring that the failure of a lower-criticality component does not compromise higher-criticality ones. The shift toward MCS is driven by the need to consolidate functionality and reduce the space, weight, and power (SWaP) overhead of using dedicated microcontrollers for each critical function. This consolidation mimics the security principle of isolating trusted and untrusted components, but with added challenges in the safety domain, where timeliness and meeting real-time deadlines are as critical as functional correctness.

Traditional MCS operating systems, such as those adhering to ARINC 653 standards, employ strict time and space partitioning (TSP) to ensure temporal and spatial isolation. Each component is statically allocated a fixed memory area and a dedicated time slice, guaranteeing isolation but at the cost of resource efficiency. To meet real-time requirements, time slices are sized to accommodate a component’s worst-case execution time (WCET), which is often significantly longer than typical execution times due to conservative estimates required for safety certification. This results in considerable processor underutilization, as slack time cannot be reallocated to other components. Additionally, strict partitioning introduces high interrupt latencies, limiting responsiveness. For instance, in an autonomous vehicle with a control loop operating every 5 ms, a 3 ms time slice may be reserved for critical processing, but this configuration delays network interrupt handling to 5 ms, impacting throughput and responsiveness to external events. Thus, while TSP ensures isolation, it inherits inefficiencies akin to traditional air-gapped systems.

MCS in seL4
^^^^^^^^^^^

The core challenge of mixed-criticality systems (MCS) is achieving strong resource isolation without the rigidity of strict time and space partitioning (TSP). In seL4, resource isolation extends beyond space to include time, with the introduction of scheduling-context capabilities. These capabilities regulate processor access, specifying how much time a component can use (time budget) and how frequently it can use that budget (time period). This mechanism ensures precise control over CPU allocation, preventing components from monopolizing the processor while maintaining responsiveness. Scheduling-context capabilities replace the traditional time slice model in seL4, offering more granular control and enabling guaranteed isolation even in mixed-criticality environments. This flexible approach allows components to utilize resources dynamically while adhering to strict isolation requirements.

For example, in a system with both critical and non-critical components, a less critical device driver can be assigned a higher priority than a critical control loop to improve responsiveness. However, the driver’s CPU usage is restricted by its time budget and period, ensuring it cannot interfere with the critical component’s deadlines. For instance, a critical controller with a budget of 3 ms and a period of 5 ms operates with guaranteed 60% CPU availability, while a high-priority driver with a smaller budget and shorter period can achieve high responsiveness without exceeding 30% CPU time. This configuration isolates the critical control from the untrusted driver, fulfilling the MCS requirement of ensuring critical components meet their deadlines regardless of the behavior of non-critical ones. seL4’s advanced time capability model represents the state of the art in MCS support for safety-critical systems.

.. admonition:: Security is no excuse for poor performance

    Performance has always been a defining feature of L4 microkernels, and seL4 continues this tradition by not only meeting but surpassing the performance of its predecessors. Designed for real-world use, seL4 aimed to lose no more than 10% in inter-process communication (IPC) performance compared to earlier kernels but instead outperformed them. While competitors rarely disclose their performance data, informal comparisons suggest other systems are typically 2 to 10 times slower than seL4, reinforcing its status as the fastest microkernel available.

Deployment and Incremental Cyber Retrofit
=========================================

When planning to secure your system with seL4, start by identifying and minimizing your critical assets and structuring them as modular, seL4-protected CAmkES components. Ensure the kernel is verified for your platform to achieve the highest assurance, though even unverified versions offer stronger guarantees than most operating systems. Additionally, assess whether the existing user-level infrastructure meets your needs; if not, the community or specialized companies can assist. Contributing useful components back to the community under an open-source license can also foster collaboration and support.

Most real-world deployments of seL4 involve legacy components that are impractical to port due to size or dependency on unsupported system services, often with minimal security benefit from running them natively. Instead, using seL4’s virtualization capabilities allows for an incremental cyber-retrofit, starting with running the entire legacy stack in a virtual machine (VM) as a baseline. For example, during DARPA’s HACMS program, the Boeing ULB mission computer initially placed its Linux system in a VM on seL4. Gradually, untrusted components like the camera software and GPS were isolated into separate VMs or native CAmkES components, while critical modules were moved to secure, native implementations. This approach transformed the system into one that was highly resilient to attacks, ensuring that even if Linux was compromised, the rest of the system remained secure.

Conclusion
==========

seL4 is the first OS kernel with formal proof of implementation correctness, extended to binary verification and security properties. It remains the most advanced verified OS, combining comprehensive verification, real-world performance, and capability-based access control. Designed for practical use, it has been refined over a decade of deployment, with major advancements like mixed-criticality support. This paper showcases seL4’s capabilities and encourages community involvement to drive its adoption and evolution.
