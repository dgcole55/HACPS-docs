High-Assurance Cyber-Physical Systems
##########################################

This course offers an in-depth introduction to high-assurance systems and their application in the design and analysis of safe and secure cyber-physical systems. Upon completing this course, students will have foundation for further study in this field, emphasizing the importance of designing and verifying computer-controlled systems to meet stringent reliability, safety, security, and correctness standards. Students will explore how to ensure these systems operate reliably under both normal and abnormal conditions, resist malicious attacks, and remain maintainable over time. The course will cover rigorous engineering practices, formal methods, verification techniques, and certification processes to achieve high assurance in system design.

Combining key areas of computer science and cyber-physical systems, the course focuses on secure microkernels and formal verification. Secure microkernels provide the essential foundation for building complex systems, ensuring they perform intended functions safely and efficiently. Formal verification, on the other hand, involves producing mathematically rigorous proofs that a system behaves according to a precise specification. By applying these techniques to cyber-physical systems, students will learn to obtain strong guarantees of security, performance, and functional correctness, even when certain aspects of the system are not formally verified.

As critical infrastructure increasingly relies on complex systems, understanding how to design systems using formal verification becomes crucial. This course aims to provide students with knowledge of formally proven cyber-physical systems. By mastering formal methods, operating system design principles, and system security concepts, graduates will be well-equipped to analyze and design high-assurance systems. The combination of theoretical knowledge and practical experience will prepare learners to contribute to trustworthy computing systems and adapt to evolving safety and security challenges in the cyber-physical landscape.

The demand for formally verified systems is growing in sectors such as aviation, automotive, infrastructure, manufacturing, energy, and other mission-critical industries. Governments and high-assurance industries now require formal verification as a prerequisite for trusted systems.  This course equips students with both theoretical and practical knowledge essential for building safe software in Industry 4.0, offering a professional advantage in tomorrow's software engineering requirements. In this course, students will gain valuable insights into using proven-secure embedded microcontrollers to design high-assurance cyber-physical systems.
