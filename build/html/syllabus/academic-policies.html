  <p>This is my system for reconsidering judgment grades.  If an obvious error is made in grading your test or homework, I will correct it immediately.  All appeals regarding severity and judgment <em>must be filed through a</em> <strong>written appeal</strong>. The appeal must include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A complete copy of the entire test or assignment, including grading rubrics.</p></li>
<li><p>A cover page describing which problem(s) are in question and what the injustice is believed to be.</p></li>
<li><p>How many points (a numerical value) you believe are owed to you.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Email the appeal to <a class="reference external" href="mailto:dgcole&#37;&#52;&#48;pitt&#46;edu">dgcole<span>&#64;</span>pitt<span>&#46;</span>edu</a> as a <strong>single PDF file</strong> for one graded assignment.</p>
<p>This information will be saved in the insurance file until the end of the term. When I compute final grades, I will consider your insurance file. If the number of points in question is sufficient to improve your grade, I will evaluate your appeal and regrade. This process saves me time, and gives you a formal process for appealing grades.</p>

<section id="academic-integrity">
<h2>Academic Integrity<a class="headerlink" href="#academic-integrity" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>All students are expected to adhere to the standards of academic honesty.  Any student engaged in cheating, plagiarism, or other acts of academic dishonesty would be subject to disciplinary action.  Any student suspected of violating this obligation for any reason during the semester will be required to participate in the procedural process, initiated at the instructor level, as outlined in the University <a class="reference external" href="http://www.provost.pitt.edu/info/ai1.html">Academic Integrity Guidelines</a>.  This may include, but is not limited to the confiscation of the examination of any individual suspected of violating the University Policy.</p>
<p>To foster a high level of academic integrity, the MEMS Department  has established a coordinated and uniform approach to dealing with violations of academic regulations against cheating and plagiarism. This approach involves disciplinary actions that increase in severity with number of instances a student has been found in violation of academic integrity.</p>
</section>
<section id="ai-policy">
<h2>AI policy<a class="headerlink" href="#ai-policy" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, such as ChatGPT, GPT, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, GitHub Copilot, and anything after, are not allowed to be used on quizzes, tests, and exams.  AI may be used on other assignments unless stated otherwise.</p>
<p>You should note that all large language models still have a tendency to make up incorrect facts and fake citations, code generation models have a tendency to produce inaccurate outputs, and image generation models can occasionally come up with highly offensive products. It is each student’s responsibility to assess the validity and applicability of any AI output that is submitted.  You will be responsible for any inaccurate, biased, offensive, or otherwise unethical content you submit regardless of whether it originally comes from you or AI.  You bear the final responsibility.</p>
<p>When using AI, any such use must be appropriately acknowledged by an AI use statement.  This statement should describe specifically how AI was used in the preparation of the assignment.  Using AI without this statement will be evaluated as if it were plagiarism.  The university’s policy on plagiarism still applies to any uncited or improperly cited use of work by other human beings, or submission of work by other human beings as your own.</p>
<p>Different classes at Pitt may implement different AI policies, and it is the student’s responsibility to conform to expectations for each course.</p>
<p>Violations of this policy will be considered academic misconduct.</p>

<p>The observance of religious holidays (activities observed by a religious group of which a student is a member) and cultural practices are an important reflection of diversity. As your instructor, I am committed to providing equivalent educational opportunities to students of all belief systems. At the beginning of the semester, you should review the course requirements to identify foreseeable conflicts with assignments, exams, or other required attendance. If at all possible, please contact me within the first two weeks of the semester to allow time for us to discuss and make fair and reasonable adjustments to the schedule and/or tasks.</p>
